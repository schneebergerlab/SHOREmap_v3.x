                        SHOREmap create   : a potential bug when reading chr-markers info is fixed (for chromosome ids
                                            with '.' in naming - lines 192,193,196,202 of find_marker_pos_2parents_v3.cpp).

                        SHOREmap extract  : work with vcf4.2 (DP and AD given but without DP4)
                        SHROEmap annotate : a potential bug in translate_as_string fixed (codon in lower cases missed before).
2017-May-12 13:46       version 3.5 
                        SHROEmap annotate : read chr-id in fasta file as the first word after '>' but before a ' '.
                                            potential bug when doing SHOREmap annotate.
                                            check coding on str.substr(): assert(EXPRESSION) before it. 
                        SHOREmap create   : potential bug for creating markers (some leading to wrong AF at markers fixed)
                        Compiling with disline-11.0.
2018-Feb-01 14:04       version 3.6    
                        SHOREmap annotate : conversion on deletions (, coordinate_end) updated
                                            coordinate_start are real start position
                                            coordinate_end   are real end   position	 
			SHOREmap annotate : read GFF with control on "ID=exon_1_1;Parent=mRNA_1;"  - TODO  
			SHOREmap annotate : potential bugs when annotating indels fixed    
			SHOREmap convert  : calculating AF with DP4 intead of DP - suggested by Emily Wynn - University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln
			COPYING_dislin    : added. Note that dislin is only free for non-commercial use, and thus SHOREmap.
