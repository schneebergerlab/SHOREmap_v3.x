# SHOREmap_v3.x

SHOREmap v3.x (latest v3.6), is hold at http://bioinfo.mpipz.mpg.de/shoremap/ : 

Whole genome resequencing of pools of recombinant mutant genomes allows directly linking phenotypic traits to causal mutations. Such an analysis, called mapping-by-sequencing, combines classical genetic mapping and next generation sequencing by relying on selection-induced patterns within genome-wide allele frequency in pooled genomes. SHOREmap is a computational tool implementing a method that enables simple and straightforward mapping-by-sequencing analysis.

SHOREmap was originally developed in the lab of Detlef Weigel and is continuously developed in the group of Korbinian Schneeberger. The latest version, SHOREmap v3.6, is developed in C/C++. Compared to the previous versions (version 2.0 or earlier), it has three new features. It accepts resequencing data that are generated in Variant Call Format (VCF), such as by SAMtools. It can make use of resequencing information of parental lines to define high-quality markers. It uses mean and coefficient of AF values to calculate stable mapping intervals.
